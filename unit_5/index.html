		<p>Marketing agencies are alike in one ironic aspect; they all claim to be different. At Stewardship Marketing Services, our office is virtual and the difference is real.</p>
		<p><b>The old agency model was for a different time</b>, and that time is past! Time was that ad agencies were temples of creativity, prosperity and cool. It made sense for a time when face-to-face meant in the same place. But really who has the time for meetings “at the agency” these days? And who’s paying for that gorgeous space?</p>
		
		<p>The employees of SMS have an average of 18 years of marketing experience...average! We&#8217re pros, the kind of workers who can mother and market effectively in the same space. Our clients are better for it; our product is better for it; and our families are better for it. And you get an A-team every day at the hourly rate you’re used to paying for the B-Team.</p>

		<h2>A discount agency?</h2> 
		<p>It's the most common client complaint &#45; the bait and switch. They're pitched by the A&#45;Team but get an inexperienced B team for the day&#45;to&#45;day. Why? Clients with today&#8217s budgets can&#8217t afford the A&#45;Team, and the reason is simple. Around 50&#37; of every dollar of agency fees is sucked up to maintain that impressive headquarters. You get what you pay for...a hip, cool environment for your inexperienced team. Is that what you wanted?</p>
